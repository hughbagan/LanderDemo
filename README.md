# LanderDemo

Use Spacebar to blast off! Tweak your flight trajectory with W, A, S, D to touch down on the pad. Gently, now, gently!

For Unreal 5.4.2

Notes:
* My GPU apparently doesn't have enough VRAM to cache multiple levels... the project has been switched to Direct X11 to hopefully relieve it a bit (but not much...).
* Adapted from the Unreal ThirdPersonCharacter template. Uses Blueprints only.
